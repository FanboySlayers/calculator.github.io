Although <i>(which mean italic ) is an inline element , when you use font awesome(icons) it becomes an Inline-block element.

You cannot set the width of an inline element and so ignores it when using relative values like % and instead check for next  parent node and so on that have valid width aka ignores inline and checks for the next block or inline block .So for example,
If you have an inline-block elemnt in an inline elemnt  and use width :60% it is the 60% of the closest block or inline or anything that is not inline;

Although img is an inline elemnt we can still use width and height properties and behaves more like an inline-block element.(I cant believe this never occurred to me :)))



Question:
Why is it that whenever I increase the size of the font awesome it doesn’t work if I select using I only but if I am very specific then it works. It even works if I only put it on it parent. 
Text-align is also weird for font awesome.
I think I got it for text-align cuz font awesome <i> becomes inline-block. But <p>,<h1>, etc are block so they can be aligned. So I should just set the width of <i> to 100% then center align.

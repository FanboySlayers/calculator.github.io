            <h2>My Life and Story</h2>
            <p>Though being originally from Bangladesh, I was born and raised in the UAE my entire life. For a matter of fact I have adopted their culture and I now call UAE my home. From a very young age my curiosity had always piqued my interests ranging from video games and computers all the way to aviation and especially the internet. So now I am on a journey to fulfill my dream as a successful full-stack web developer so I may be able to create unique web applications that will be of very use in today's technically advanced world.</p>
